# kokoro

**Kokoro** is an open-weight TTS model with 82 million parameters. Despite its lightweight architecture, it delivers comparable quality to larger models while being significantly faster and more cost-efficient. With Apache-licensed weights, Kokoro can be deployed anywhere from production environments to personal projects.

This repo is a Work-In-Progress port of Kokoro TTS model to Swift using MLX framework.
